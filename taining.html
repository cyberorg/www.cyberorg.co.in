Why Linux administration?

The findings of this report make it clear that Linux professionals are amongst the most sought after in the current tech market. However, a more interesting finding of the report is that amongst all the skills, the hiring managers are most actively seeking system administration, with 58 percent confirming they were on look out of professionals with good system administration skills. The reason is quite simple. There aren’t too many good system administrators out there, which is also driving the salaries of system admins northwards.

Salaries and Benefits

The compensations for Linux administrators are generally on the higher side. As per PayScale, the annual median salary is around INR 3.85 lacs for entry level professionals (as updated on 27th March, 2015). With experience, there is an exponential increase in the salary levels as individuals with 5+ years of experience getting annual packages in seven figures.

Well, with the grass being greener for Linux professionals this year, you won’t get a better opportunity or time for pursuing career as a Linux system administrator.
